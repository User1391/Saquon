In twenty-twenty-three we thought we had it made
The day we went ten and one it seemed we could go all the way
Yet every victory was met with great dismay
Banking on field goals to save the day 

In the off season we added some new recruits 
Dejean, Mitchell and Baun to name a few
But there was one player who would change the game
And bring Philadelphia back to their fame 

Number twenty-six
The one who put Philly back in the mix 

Saquon Barkley is his name 
And for the Eagles success he is to blame 
He’s the one running back in the league every defense has failed to attack 
As he moves down the field the entire stadium is taken aback 

He shocked the world by jumping so high
In a backwards hurdle that made millions chant “fly eagles fly” 
Since then not a week has gone by without that same victory cry

Saquon Barkley, 
He is our hero
Without him our moral would be at a zero

He is the backbone of this city 
Out-doing even Gritty
The NFL is amazed 
And by all of Philadelphia he is praised 

Saquon Barkley,
He is our number one 
Hoping he can bring us to the victory line
At Superbowl fifty-nine
