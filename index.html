        <h1>Saquon Barkley: Our Hero</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            <p class="line">In twenty-twenty-three we thought we had it made</p>
            <p class="line">The day we went ten and one it seemed we could go all the way</p>
            <p class="line">Yet every victory was met with great dismay</p>
            <p class="line">Banking on field goals to save the day</p>

            <p class="line">In the off season we added some new recruits</p>
            <p class="line">Dejean, Mitchell, and Baun to name a few</p>
            <p class="line">But there was one player who would change the game</p>
            <p class="line">And bring Philadelphia back to their fame</p>

            <p class="line">Number twenty-six</p>
            <p class="line">The one who put Philly back in the mix</p>

            <p class="line">Saquon Barkley is his name</p>
            <p class="line">And for the Eagles' success, he is to blame</p>
            <p class="line">He's the one running back in the league every defense has failed to attack</p>
            <p class="line">As he moves down the field, the entire stadium is taken aback</p>

            <p class="line">He shocked the world by jumping so high</p>
            <p class="line">In a backwards hurdle that made millions chant "fly eagles fly"</p>
            <p class="line">Since then, not a week has gone by without that same victory cry</p>

            <p class="line">Saquon Barkley,</p>
            <p class="line">He is our hero</p>
            <p class="line">Without him, our morale would be at a zero</p>

            <p class="line">He is the backbone of this city</p>
            <p class="line">Out-doing even Gritty</p>
            <p class="line">The NFL is amazed</p>
            <p class="line">And by all of Philadelphia, he is praised</p>

            <p class="line">Saquon Barkley,</p>
            <p class="line">He is our number one</p>
            <p class="line">Hoping he can bring us to the victory line</p>
            <p class="line">At Superbowl fifty-nine</p>
